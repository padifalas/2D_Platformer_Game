* Animations are controlled by the 'MovingEntity_animCtrl' Animatior Controller.
* Location: [Assets>anim>moving_entity]
* The controller has a parameter named 'animState' which controls which animation plays.
* 'animState' is an integer, here are the animations that it's value represents:

0 = idle
1 = walk
2 = jumping (blend tree containing 2 clips, controlled by 'jumpFallBlend' float parameter, remeber to set it!)
3 = duck
4 = shoot

* You can add more animations if you need to, just keep counting up from 5...
